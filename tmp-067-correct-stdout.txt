Hi
dressed she life in lives too loove foor be 

Setting loonely suns loovers aand free 
feels never like see I 
Stroolling the sloowly sun toowaards 
Soooothing thaat every coomes waave 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
     1	We whoole are noot 
     2	We're pinheads noow 
     3	We're pinheads all 
     4	Joockoo hoomoo 
     5	Are men? we noot 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
solid life of crime 
a of odd man circumstance 
a of ghetto victim demands 
feed money for me style 
and while i'll a let for you trip 
insecure from the past 
how last? good thing can a long 
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
Gonnaaaa kill me for sure...i meaaaan they gaaaanged up on me like thaaaat, 
Go out on the streets like this...you caaaan't...daaaangerous plaaaace, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaaaaking. it's weird. 
i saaaay I'm nervous aaaas hell from this thing 'caaaause those guys were 
It's aaaa daaaangerous plaaaace
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
     11	     11	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four

     8	     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
