Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
     1	I've been working on it baby
     2	I've been thinking about it you see,
     3	I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
     4	I don't have your phone number, honey
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
     1	Love me right
     2	What's the matter with you
     3	Hold me tight
     4	Why must I tell you what to do
     5	Smile ain't hidin'
     6	What I see in your eyes
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Hi
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
     1	Love me right
     2	What's the matter with you
     3	Hold me tight
     4	Why must I tell you what to do
     5	Smile ain't hidin'
     6	What I see in your eyes
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
     1	I've been working on it baby
     2	I've been thinking about it you see,
     3	I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
     4	I don't have your phone number, honey
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all

Are we not men?

Are we not men? 
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
