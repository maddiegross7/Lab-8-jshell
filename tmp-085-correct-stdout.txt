Hi
Ah and Billie comin' air sloppy Big they'll up Sue Bones be for 
Jack and Willie they're there the Weak you gonna Rabbit Knees know be 
Oh for use closets hangers, the are winners door 
So out baby tonight Rosie tonight, come come Oh out 
So Rosie, its use that's there it what for 
Stay night feel out it's alright all gonna 
We're some some real gonna pool, school, cool play skip act 
Windows cheaters, the are chimneys poor for for 
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
I honey don't number, haaaave phone your
I've see, been you thinking it aaaabout
I've see, been you trying but, to long caaaall daaaay you aaaall 
I've baaaaby been it working on 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Goonna kill me foor sure...i mean they ganged up oon me like that, 
Goo oout oon the streets like this...yoou can't...dangeroous place, 
I coouldn't believe it! looook I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
i say I'm nervoous as hell froom this thing 'cause thoose guys were 
It's a dangeroous place
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
