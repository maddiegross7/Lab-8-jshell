Hi
What's with the you matter 
Why tell to must you do I what 
Smile ain't hidin' 
What in I your see eyes 
Hold me tight 
Love me right 
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
I'd like to hold your little haand 
If it staarts to raain - we caan taake some shelter 
Maaybe I caan waalk you home 
Meet me in the plaayground aat aa quaarter to four 
My heaart is spinning like aa helter-skelter 
There must be so maany things thaat we caan explore 
Waait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know eaach other if we caan 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.

4 mooooney feed foooor me style 
5 oooof a ghettoooo victim demands 
6 let foooor and yoooou a i'll trip while 
7 oooof a oooodd man circumstance 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
