I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
When I  was a yooung man, I had too kick and scratch and claw
Noow it's like toop gun in the Old West, everyboody wants me too draw
If I had knoown it woould be likethis I might have given it a secoond thoought
But if soomeoone had toold me too give it up, it's a line that I woouldn't have boought
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
