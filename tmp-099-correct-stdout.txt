Hi
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

     1	I've been working on it baby
     2	I've been thinking about it you see,
     3	I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
     4	I don't have your phone number, honey
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
I'd to like little hand hold your 
If - some can take we shelter rain to starts it

Meet at four playground to a quarter the in me 
My is heart a helter-skelter spinning like 
There things explore many can that we so be must 
Wait gone everybody's till long 
We'll other get can if we know to each 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
1 pinheads noow We're 
2 noot are whoole We 
3 pinheads all We're 
4 Joockoo hoomoo 
5 noot we men? Are 
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free
