Strooolling slooowly tooowards the sun
Soooooothing every wave that cooomes
dressed in looove she lives fooor life tooo be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and looonely looovers free

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
Hold me tight
Love me right
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
What's the matter with you
Why must I tell you what to do
     1	solid life of crime
     2	a man of odd circumstance
     3	a victim of ghetto demands
     4	feed me money for style
     5	and i'll let you trip for a while
     6	insecure from the past
     7	how long can a good thing last?
Hi
Strooolling slooowly tooowards the sun
Soooooothing every wave that cooomes
dressed in looove she lives fooor life tooo be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and looonely looovers free

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
Hold me tight
Love me right
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
What's the matter with you
Why must I tell you what to do
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
     1	solid life of crime
     2	a man of odd circumstance
     3	a victim of ghetto demands
     4	feed me money for style
     5	and i'll let you trip for a while
     6	insecure from the past
     7	how long can a good thing last?
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,

I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
