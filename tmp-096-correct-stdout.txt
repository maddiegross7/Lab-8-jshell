Hi
a odd man circumstance of 
solid crime life of 
feed for me style money 
a ghetto victim demands of 
insecure past from the 
and you a i'll trip while let for 
how a last? long good can thing 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
When a I kick and I yooung had and claw was man, too scratch 
Noow toop the everyboody too it's gun Old wants draw like in West, me 
If knoown be might it thoought I it likethis have a had woould I given secoond 
But had too up, line woouldn't if toold give it's that have soomeoone me it a I boought 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
We are not whole
We're pinheads now
Jocko homo
We're pinheads all
Are we not men? 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Whaat's the maatter with you
Why must I tell you whaat to do
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
