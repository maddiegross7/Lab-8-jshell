Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
I've been wooorking ooon it baby
I've been thinking abooout it yooou see,
I've been trying tooo call yooou all day looong but, yooou see,
I dooon't have yooour phooone number, hoooney
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Hi
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
I've been wooorking ooon it baby
I've been thinking abooout it yooou see,
I've been trying tooo call yooou all day looong but, yooou see,
I dooon't have yooour phooone number, hoooney
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men?

Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
