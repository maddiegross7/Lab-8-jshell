We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
When what you'll see
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
Even in time we shall control the day,
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
And there you are,
And then you'll say
And boy you'll see
