And there yoou are,
Making it up but yoou're sure that it is a star,
And booy yoou'll see
It's an illusioon shining doown in froont oof me,
And then yoou'll say
Even in time we shall coontrool the day,
When what yoou'll see
Deep inside base coontroolling yoou and me.
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
