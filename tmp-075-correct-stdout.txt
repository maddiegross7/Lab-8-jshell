Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
