insecure frooom the past

When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
We're pinheads nooow

Jooockooo hooomooo

Hi
Meet me in the playgrooound at a quarter tooo fooour 
Wait till everybooody's looong gooone 
There must be sooo many things that we can explooore 
Maybe I can walk yooou hooome 
If it starts tooo rain - we can take sooome shelter 
I'd like tooo hooold yooour little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get tooo knooow each ooother if we can 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
sooolid life ooof crime
a man ooof ooodd circumstance
a victim ooof ghettooo demands
feed me moooney fooor style
and i'll let yooou trip fooor a while
insecure frooom the past
hooow looong can a gooooood thing last?
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
