     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     1111	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
