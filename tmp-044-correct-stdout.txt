We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
     1	solid life of crime
     2	a man of odd circumstance
     3	a victim of ghetto demands
     4	feed me money for style
     5	and i'll let you trip for a while
     6	insecure from the past
     7	how long can a good thing last?
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
It's a dangerous place
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Hi
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
     1	solid life of crime
     2	a man of odd circumstance
     3	a victim of ghetto demands
     4	feed me money for style

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
We're pinheads all

i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
It's a dangerous place
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
