3 aa It's daangeroooous plaace 
5 kill me sure...i gaanged Goooonnaa like foooor up they thaat, me oooon meaan 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Wait till everyboody's loong goone 
Meet me in the playgroound at a quarter too foour 
Maybe I can walk yoou hoome 
There must be soo many things that we can exploore 
I'd like too hoold yoour little hand 
If it starts too rain - we can take soome shelter 
We'll get too knoow each oother if we can 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
6 me Hold tight

2 maatter Whaat's with you the 
11111111 you Why tell do whaat must I to
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands

insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
