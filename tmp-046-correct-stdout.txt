     1	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

i say I'm nervooous as hell frooom this thing 'cause thooose guys were 
Gooonna kill me fooor sure...i mean they ganged up ooon me like that, 
I cooouldn't believe it! looooook I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Gooo ooout ooon the streets like this...yooou can't...dangerooous place, 
It's a dangerooous place
I don't have your phone number, honey
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I've been working on it baby
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
Hi
     1	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all

Are we not men?

I cooouldn't believe it! looooook I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Gooo ooout ooon the streets like this...yooou can't...dangerooous place, 
It's a dangerooous place
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

I don't have your phone number, honey
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I've been working on it baby
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought

Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
