Goooonnaa foooor they oooon thaat, kill sure...i gaanged me me meaan up like 
I it! still weird. coooouldn't looooooook shaaking. believe I'm it's 
Goooo the this...yoooou oooout streets caan't...daangeroooous oooon like plaace, 
It's plaace aa daangeroooous 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Strolling the slowly sun towaaaaaaaards 
Soothing thaaaaaaaat every comes waaaaaaaave 
Setting lonely suns lovers aaaaaaaand free 
feels never like see I 
dressed she life in lives to love for be 

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
Windoooows are foooor cheaters, chimneys foooor the poooooooor
We're goooonna play soooome pooooooool, skip soooome schooooooool, act real cooooooool
Stay oooout all night it's goooonna feel alright
Soooo use it Roooosie, that's what its there foooor
Soooo Roooosie coooome oooout toooonight, Oh baby coooome oooout toooonight
Oh cloooosets are foooor hangers, winners use the doooooooor
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie yoooou knoooow they're goooonna be there
Ah slooooppy Sue and Big Boooones Billie they'll be coooomin' up foooor air
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
Whaat's the maatter with you
Love me right
Why must I tell you whaat to do
Hold me tight
Whaat I see in your eyes
Smile aain't hidin'
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
     1	I've been thinking about it you see,
     2	I've been working on it baby
     3	I don't have your phone number, honey
     4	I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
