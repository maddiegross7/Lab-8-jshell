feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Are we not men? 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
It's a dangerous place
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
