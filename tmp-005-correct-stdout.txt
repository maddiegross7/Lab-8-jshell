And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free
