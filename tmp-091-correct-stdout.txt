When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought

Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
a of circumstance odd man

i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
