     1	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
     1	Strolling slowly towards the sun
     2	Soothing every wave that comes
     3	dressed in love she lives for life to be
     4	feels like I never see
     5	Setting suns and lonely lovers free
     6	
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
And there yooou are,
Making it up but yooou're sure that it is a star,
And boooy yooou'll see
It's an illusiooon shining dooown in frooont ooof me,
And then yooou'll say
Even in time we shall cooontroool the day,
When what yooou'll see
Deep inside base cooontrooolling yooou and me.
Hi
     1	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
And there yooou are,
Making it up but yooou're sure that it is a star,
And boooy yooou'll see
It's an illusiooon shining dooown in frooont ooof me,
And then yooou'll say
Even in time we shall cooontroool the day,
When what yooou'll see
Deep inside base cooontrooolling yooou and me.
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
