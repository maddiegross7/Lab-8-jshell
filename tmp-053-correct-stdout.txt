I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
We're pinheads nooow
We are nooot whooole
We're pinheads all
Jooockooo hooomooo
Are we nooot men? 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie yooou knooow they're gooonna be there
Ah sloooppy Sue and Big Booones Billie they'll be cooomin' up fooor air
We're gooonna play sooome pooooool, skip sooome schooooool, act real cooooool
Stay ooout all night it's gooonna feel alright
Sooo Rooosie cooome ooout tooonight, Oh baby cooome ooout tooonight
Windooows are fooor cheaters, chimneys fooor the poooooor
Oh clooosets are fooor hangers, winners use the doooooor
Sooo use it Rooosie, that's what its there fooor
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Hi
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
We're pinheads nooow
We are nooot whooole
We're pinheads all
Jooockooo hooomooo
Are we nooot men? 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie yooou knooow they're gooonna be there
Ah sloooppy Sue and Big Booones Billie they'll be cooomin' up fooor air
We're gooonna play sooome pooooool, skip sooome schooooool, act real cooooool
Stay ooout all night it's gooonna feel alright
Sooo Rooosie cooome ooout tooonight, Oh baby cooome ooout tooonight
Windooows are fooor cheaters, chimneys fooor the poooooor
Oh clooosets are fooor hangers, winners use the doooooor
Sooo use it Rooosie, that's what its there fooor
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
We're pinheads nooow
We are nooot whooole
We're pinheads all
Jooockooo hooomooo
