Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air

Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor

     2	Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that,

solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands

and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?

Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can

     6	What I see in your eyes
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
And there yooou are,
Making it up but yooou're sure that it is a star,
And boooy yooou'll see
It's an illusiooon shining dooown in frooont ooof me,
