Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for

Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'

I've see, been you thinking it aabout
I've see, been you trying but, to long caall daay you aall 
I honey don't number, haave phone your
I've baaby been it working on 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
solid life of crime
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
feed me money for style
a victim of ghetto demands
and i'll let you trip for a while
a man of odd circumstance
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
We'll knoow if get eaaaach we too oother caaaan 
Waaaait everyboody's goone till loong 
There caaaan be things exploore soo thaaaat we must maaaany 
My spinning is heaaaart like aaaa helter-skelter 
Meet too in aaaat foour the aaaa quaaaarter me plaaaaygroound
