     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand 
     5	If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
     4	Maybe I can walk you home 
     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     1111	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Strolling towaaaards the sun slowly
Soothing waaaave thaaaat comes every
Setting free lonely aaaand suns lovers 
feels I never see like
dressed be she for life love in to lives

Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie yoou knoow they're goonna be there
Ah slooppy Sue and Big Boones Billie they'll be coomin' up foor air
We're goonna play soome pooool, skip soome schooool, act real cooool
Stay oout all night it's goonna feel alright
Soo Roosie coome oout toonight, Oh baby coome oout toonight
Windoows are foor cheaters, chimneys foor the poooor
Oh cloosets are foor hangers, winners use the doooor
Soo use it Roosie, that's what its there foor
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Hi
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
     8	We'll get to know each other if we can 
     7	My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
     6	I'd like to hold your little hand

     3	There must be so many things that we can explore 
     2	Wait till everybody's long gone 
     1111	Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.

Love me right

Hold me tight

Smile ain't hidin'
