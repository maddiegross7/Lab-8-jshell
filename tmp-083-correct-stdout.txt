Hi
     2	I've been thinking aabout it you see,
     1111	I don't haave your phone number, honey
     4	I've been working on it baaby
     3	I've been trying to caall you aall daay long but, you see,
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

We're pinheads now
We're pinheads all
We are not whole
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
When kick young claw to a and had was scratch I I and man, 
Now everybody gun draw West, top to Old like me the it's wants in 
If might I have would second known it it a I be thought likethis had given 
But up, if it's someone a had line told that me I to wouldn't give have it bought 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Ah air sloppy for Sue up and comin' Big be Bones they'll Billie

So tonight Rosie out come come out baby tonight, Oh 
Stay alright out feel all gonna night it's 
We're cool gonna real play act some school, pool, some skip
Windows poor are the for for cheaters, chimneys 
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
It's dangerous place a 
i guys nervous thing from hell 'cause I'm were those say this as
I it's it! I'm still believe weird. shaking. couldn't look 
Go place, the like this...you on out can't...dangerous streets

What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
