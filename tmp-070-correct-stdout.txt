I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I don't have your phone number, honey
And then yoou'll say
And booy yoou'll see
Deep inside base coontroolling yoou and me.
And there yoou are,
It's an illusioon shining doown in froont oof me,
Even in time we shall coontrool the day,
When what yoou'll see
Making it up but yoou're sure that it is a star,
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
Gonnaa for they on thaat, kill sure...i gaanged me me meaan up like
