Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place,

Hi
Meet me in the playgrooound at a quarter tooo fooour 
Wait till everybooody's looong gooone 
There must be sooo many things that we can explooore 
Maybe I can walk yooou hooome 
If it starts tooo rain - we can take sooome shelter 
I'd like tooo hooold yooour little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get tooo knooow each ooother if we can 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
I've been wooorking ooon it baby
I've been thinking abooout it yooou see,
I've been trying tooo call yooou all day looong but, yooou see,
I dooon't have yooour phooone number, hoooney
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
When I  was a yoooung man, I had tooo kick and scratch and claw
Nooow it's like tooop gun in the Old West, everybooody wants me tooo draw
If I had knooown it wooould be likethis I might have given it a secooond thooought
But if sooomeooone had tooold me tooo give it up, it's a line that I wooouldn't have booought
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
Meet me in the playgrooound at a quarter tooo fooour
