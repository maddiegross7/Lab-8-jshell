Hi
8 me. Deep and inside yoou base coontroolling 
7 see When yoou'll what
6 day, Even the in coontrool time shall we
5 say And yoou'll then
4 me, It's oof an froont illusioon in shining doown 
3 see And yoou'll booy
2 star, Making a it is up it but that yoou're sure 
1 are, And yoou there
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
1 11 11 I've been working on it baby 
2 see, it you I've 2 2 about been thinking 
3 all been you you I've but, call 3 long to 3 day trying see, 
4 honey phone number, I 4 4 your don't have 
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?

2 the quarter Meet 11 a playgroound too in foour me at 
11 Wait goone loong 2 everyboody's till
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Are noot men? we 
Joockoo hoomoo 
We're all pinheads 
We're noow pinheads 
We noot whoole are 
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free
