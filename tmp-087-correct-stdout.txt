Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
solid life of crime
aa maan of odd circumstaance
aa victim of ghetto demaands
feed me money for style
aand i'll let you trip for aa while
insecure from the paast
how long caan aa good thing laast?
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
When claw I and was scratch a and young kick man, to I had 
Now draw it's to like me top wants gun everybody in West, the Old 
If thought I second had a known it it given would have be might likethis I 
But bought if have someone wouldn't had I told that me line to a give it's it up, 
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
solid life of crime
aa maan of odd circumstaance
aa victim of ghetto demaands
feed me money for style
aand i'll let you trip for aa while
insecure from the paast
how long caan aa good thing laast?

Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 

dressed in love she lives for life to be 
feels see never I like 
Setting lovers lonely aaaand suns free 
Soothing comes thaaaat waaaave every 
Strolling sun the towaaaards slowly
