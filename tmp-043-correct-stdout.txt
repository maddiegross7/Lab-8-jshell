Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
I don't have your phone number, honey
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I've been working on it baby
And there yooou are,
Making it up but yooou're sure that it is a star,
And boooy yooou'll see
It's an illusiooon shining dooown in frooont ooof me,
And then yooou'll say
Even in time we shall cooontroool the day,
When what yooou'll see
Deep inside base cooontrooolling yooou and me.
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
Hi
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Soothing every wave that comes
dressed in love she lives for life to be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and lonely lovers free

Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
i say I'm nervous as hell from this thing 'cause those guys were 
Gonna kill me for sure...i mean they ganged up on me like that, 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight

I've been working on it baby
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all

Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
I don't have your phone number, honey

It's a dangerous place
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
And there yooou are,
Making it up but yooou're sure that it is a star,
And boooy yooou'll see
It's an illusiooon shining dooown in frooont ooof me,
And then yooou'll say
