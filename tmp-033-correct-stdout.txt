I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
     1	Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they're gonna be there
     2	Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they'll be comin' up for air
     3	We're gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool
     4	Stay out all night it's gonna feel alright
     5	So Rosie come out tonight, Oh baby come out tonight
     6	Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
     7	Oh closets are for hangers, winners use the door
     8	So use it Rosie, that's what its there for
Strooolling slooowly tooowards the sun
Soooooothing every wave that cooomes
dressed in looove she lives fooor life tooo be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and looonely looovers free

Hi
I've been working on it baby
I've been thinking about it you see,
I've been trying to call you all day long but, you see,
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
I'd like to hold your little hand 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
Maybe I can walk you home 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
I couldn't believe it! look I'm still shaking. it's weird. 
Go out on the streets like this...you can't...dangerous place, 
It's a dangerous place
And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.
Strooolling slooowly tooowards the sun
Soooooothing every wave that cooomes
dressed in looove she lives fooor life tooo be
feels like I never see
Setting suns and looonely looovers free

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men?

When I  was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be likethis I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have bought
I've been working on it baby
